# Comments in Style

Ever wanted to mark important part of your comment in **Bold**? maybe in *Italics*? Why not both?
Comment Formatter allows you to do so and much more!
By substituting regular ASCII characters with Unicode you can use **Bold**, *Italics*, <u>Underline</u>, 𝕆𝕦𝕥𝕝𝕚𝕟𝕖 and even ˢᵘᵖᵉʳˢᶜʳᶦᵖᵗ in your regular programming code.




## Features

Describe specific features of your extension including screenshots of your extension in action. Image paths are relative to this README file.

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

\!\[feature X\]\(images/feature-x.png\)

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

## Requirements

If you have any requirements or dependencies, add a section describing those and how to install and configure them.

## Extension Settings

Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `myExtension.enable`: enable/disable this extension
* `myExtension.thing`: set to `blah` to do something

## Known Issues

► In 𝘗𝘺𝘊𝘩𝘢𝘳𝘮, the hidden codes (for color/font size) may become visible. 
They can be removed by clicking "Enable font ligatures" under Settings->Editor->Font

► If you encounter slowness while typing try disabling other extensions, especially colorizing ones like "𝘉𝘳𝘢𝘤𝘬𝘦𝘵 𝘗𝘢𝘪𝘳 𝘊𝘰𝘭𝘰𝘳𝘪𝘻𝘦𝘳".

► Spell checks may not identify unicode characters correctly
For cSpell users, add the following setting:
<pre>
"cSpell.ignoreRegExpList": [
  "/[𝕒-𝕫𝔸-𝕐ℂℍℕℙℚℝℤ𝟘-𝟡𝙖-𝙯𝘼-𝙕𝗮-𝘇𝗔-𝗭𝘢-𝘻𝘈-𝘡͟ᵃ-ᶻᴬ-ᵂ𝐚-𝐳𝐀-𝐙𝑎-𝑧𝐴-𝑍𝒂-𝒛𝑨-𝒁̶]+/ug"
]
</pre>
